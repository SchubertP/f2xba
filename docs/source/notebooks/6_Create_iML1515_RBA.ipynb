    "# 6. Tutorial: Create iML1515 RBA model\n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the workflows delineated in the preceding tutorials, with minimal effort, we generated enzyme constraint GECKO models from a well-annotated genome-scale metabolic model (GEM), and subsequently adjusted model parameters. The f2xba framework supported the model generation, optimization, and results analysis. The extension of a genome-scale model, utilized for FBA analysis, to a GECKO model necessitated the division of enzyme-catalyzed reactions into forward and reverse directions and per isoenzyme. It also entailed the introduction of protein concentration variables, the addition of coupling constraints to link reaction fluxes to protein requirements, and the replacement of constraints on nutrient uptake fluxes with a total protein constraint. The fixed biomass reaction was retained in the GECKO model and served as a proxy for the specific growth rate. The majority of the model parameters were retrieved automatically from online resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will generate a resource balance constraint (RBA) (Goelzer et al., 2011) model of iML1515, the latest genome-scale metabolic model of *E. coli*. The f2xba package creates RBA models based on the formalism used in RBApy (Bulović et al., 2019), with some improvements. While RBApy exports models in a proprietary format, RBA models created with f2xba are fully annotated and formatted in standardized SBML language, allowing processing by SBML-compliant tools. Workflows for RBA model creation, optimization, and results analysis are consistent with the workflows for enzyme constraint GECKO models introduced in the previous tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will reuse the configuration data of our final GECKO model, including the auto-fitted turnover numbers. RBA necessitates a substantial augmentation of the metabolic network, incorporating organism-specific knowledge. Key components of RBA models are designated as \"process machines\" for macromolecule processing, including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, protein folding, and targeting. Furthermore, RBA employs compartment-specific capacity constraints for total protein and RNA, superseding the total protein constraint in GECKO models. The fixed biomass reaction employed in FBA and GECKO modeling is substituted by enzyme requirements and concentration targets. Michaelis-Menten derived rate laws are used for nutrient uptake reactions, and media conditions must be defined as specific nutrient concentrations rather than placing constraints on uptake fluxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problems used for FBA and GECKO are replaced by feasibility problems, using a bisection algorithm to test for the maximal growth rate. At each growth rate, variable bounds and matrix coefficients must be recalculated and updated. RBA models coded in SBML utilize SBML features that are not accessible by cobrapy, such as initial assignments. Although cobrapy will be employed for RBA model loading and optimization, support by f2xba features is necessary. For larger and more complex models, such as genome-scale RBA models, the optimization interface based on gurobipy can provide substantial performance improvements over cobrapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RBA implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "A comparison of the RBA and GECKO models reveals notable distinctions in their implementation. In the RBA model, reactions are divided according to isoenzyme, and no splitting in forward and reverse directions is required. Reactions are coupled at the enzyme level, while in the GECKO model, they are coupled at the protein level. The RBA model contains enzyme concentration variables, while the GECKO model contains protein concentration variables. A one-to-one relationship exists between reactions and modeled enzymes, with enzyme identifiers being derived from reaction identifiers. Enzymes are composed of proteins, which need to be produced by process machines. Enzymes may also require cofactors, which need to be provided by the metabolic network. The expression of protein and RNA masses is carried out in units of average amino acids, while the capacity constraints present in different compartments are expressed in units of mmol amino acids per gram cell dry weight (mmolAA/gDW).\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme efficiency constraints for the forward $\\text{C_EF}_i$ and reverse $\\text{C_ER}_i$ directions couple reaction fluxes $\\text{R}_i$ [mmol/gDWh] with enzyme concentrations $\\text{V_EC}_i$ [µmol/gDW] using apparent catalytic constants $\\text{kcat_app}_i$ [$h^{-1}$].\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{C_EF}_i: \\text{R}_i - \\text{kcat_app}_i \\cdot \\text{V_EC}_i \\cdot 0.001 \\leq 0$  \n",
    "$\\text{C_ER}_i: - \\text{R}_i - \\text{kcat_app}_i \\cdot \\text{V_EC}_i \\cdot 0.001  \\leq 0$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent catalytic constants are determined from the turnover numbers $\\text{kcat}_i$ [$s^{-1}$], the number of active sites $\\text{n_AS}_i$, and the average enzyme saturation $\\text{avg_enz_sat}$, which is used for all reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{kcat_app}_i = \\text{kcat}_i \\cdot \\text{n_AS}_i  \\cdot \\text{avg_enz_sat}  \\cdot 3600$\n",
    "\n",
    "Macromolecular production reactions are incorporated to synthesize explicitly modeled proteins (e.g., R_PROD_b2907), balance dummy proteins (e.g., R_PROD_dummy_protein_im), and total DNA (R_PROD_dna), total mRNA (R_PROD_mrna), individual tRNAs (e.g., R_PROD_trnaala) and individual rRNAs (e.g., R_PROD_rRNA_16S), using metabolites produced in the metabolic reaction network. Process machine capacity constraints (e.g., C_PMC_pm_translation) couple these macromolecular production reactions to process machine concentrations (e.g., V_PMC_pm_translation) in the same way as metabolic reactions are coupled to enzyme requirements. Macromolecular degradation reactions are added in a similar way (e.g., R_DEGR_mrna).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that macromolecules undergo dilution due to cellular growth. Mass balance constraints for macromolecules (e.g., MM_b2907) ensure that macromolecule production, degradation, and dilution are balanced. The dilution of modeled proteins and ribosomal RNAs is governed by enzyme concentration (e.g., V_EC_FBA_iso1) and process machine concentration (e.g., V_PCM_pm_translation) variables. The dilution of other macromolecules due to growth is managed by specific target concentration variables (e.g., V_TMMC_mrna). The variable 'V_TSMC' [µmol/gDW] controls the growth dilution of selected metabolites, mainly derived from the biomass pseudo reaction of the foundational GEM. Compartmental capacity limits are controlled by the variable 'V_TCD' [mmolAA/gDW]. Density constraints (e.g., C_D_im) serve to regulate the concentrations of enzymes, processes, machines, and macromolecular targets, ensuring that these concentrations do not exceed the capacities of the respective compartments.\n",

    "RBA models are considerably more intricate than GECKO models and necessitate a significant investment in model parametrization. Fortunately, numerous parameters have already been delineated in the GECKO model, and this configuration data can be reused. The data that will be added is relatively structured and can be easily reused with minimal modifications. The RBA model that will be developed in this tutorial is relatively sophisticated. In practice, it might be more prudent to begin with a very simple RBA model, such as one that has only a single process machinery for protein synthesis. This preliminary model can then be extended iteratively to gain more control over parametrization and to identify any modeling problems. As with the GECKO model, the generation of the RBA model is based on configuration files. In this case, we required XBA and RBA configuration files."

    "\n",
    "The XBA configuration file, which was utilized to generate the baseline GECKO model, is expanded. Within the `general` table, the GenBank accession identifier for the ‘*Escherichia coli* str. K-12 substr. MG1655’ chromosome is assigned to the parameter `chromosome2accids`. Additionally, the inclusion of cofactors in enzyme compositions is requested by setting the `cofactor_flag` to ‘True’.  The cofactor requirements are extracted from UniProt and mapped to metabolites in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `modify_addrs` table will not be reused; rather, a new table is created in which three transport reactions are blocked by setting the upper flux bound to zero. It is not necessary to explicitly block the reaction ‘GLCDpp’ because RBA will not use this reaction unless the cofactor PQQ is supplied, which is also added to the model species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protein translation machinery that is to be introduced requires charged tRNAs for translation initiation and elongation; with the exception of glutamyl-tRNA, iML1515 natively cannot synthesize charged tRNAs. Consequently, the tRNA charging reactions must be incorporated into the reaction network (`add_reactions` table), along with model species representing charged and uncharged tRNAs (`add_species`) and the gene products necessary to catalyze tRNA charging reactions (`add_gps`). The iJO1366 model (Orth et al., 2011) is the precursor to the iML1515 model. The tRNA charging reactions were defined in the iJO1366 model and were subsequently eliminated during the construction of the iML1515 model. The relevant reaction data acquired from the iJO1366 model has been compiled in the `data` structure. This data is utilized in the automatic generation of most configuration data.\n",

    "#### Configuration data for other organisms:   \n",
    "\n",
    "The RBA model creation process necessitates the utilization of information from the genome to ascertain the composition of various types of RNA and DNA. Additionally, genome information can be employed to determine protein composition in instances where UniProt protein data records for the organism are not available. It is imperative to assign either NCBI GenBank or RefSeq accession numbers to the parameter `chromosome2accids`. It should be noted that the corresponding genome records contain the gene locus identifiers employed in the model. In instances where the genome is distributed across multiple chromosomes and/or plastids, it is essential that all pertinent segments are provided. For instance, the values designated for the parameter `chromosome2accids` in the configuration file for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* may begin with: 'Chr_I=BK006935.2, Chr_II=BK006936.2, Chr_III=BK006937.2, …'."

Numerical values in RBA can be constant values, derived from functions of growth rate or species concentration, or aggregates (multiplication) of functions. The relevant data is configured in the table `functions`. Configuration data for process machines is spread across three different tables: `processes`, containing general processes data; `machineries`, defining the composition of process machines; and `processing_maps`, defining macromolecular components and processing steps. The table `trna2locus` contains configuration data for tRNAs, while `compartments` contains compartment-specific information. Concentration and flux targets are configured in the table `targets`.  Detailed configuration data is created automatically where possible, based on parameter input and templates. "

    "\n",
    "In practice, the configuration of process machines is executed incrementally, a method that is supported by the workflow presented below. The definition of relevant data is performed separately for each process machine, and the acquisition of most data is typically straightforward, often requiring only organism-specific knowledge. The data is first collected in the dictionaries, and subsequently, we generate the detailed configuration data and requisite tables automatically. The seven processes intended for inclusion in the RBA model are as follows: DNA replication, stable RNA transcription for rRNA and tRNA synthesis, mRNA transcription for mRNA synthesis, mRNA degradation, protein synthesis, protein folding, and protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python dictionary `proc_data`, we collate general process-related information for each process machine. This includes a process identifier (`process`), a descriptive name (`name`), and the type of process (`type`). The latter can be set to ‘production’ or ‘degradation’. The connected processing map identifier (`processing_map`), the kind of macromolecules being processed (`set`), which can be set to 'dna', 'rna' or 'protein', and a filter applied to the selected set of macromolecules (`input_filter`). The filter, if defined, can be a comma-separated list of regular expression patterns applied to the macromolecule identifiers or the value ‘signal_peptide’ to filter proteins containing a signal peptide as per the corresponding UniProt record. The capacity of the process machine is also defined in terms of individual reaction steps per hour, similar to the turnover number used for enzymatic reactions. The capacity can be defined as a constant value (`capacity_constant`), a function definition (`capacity_function`), or an aggregate of functions (`capacity_aggregate`), in which case the functions need to be defined and added to `func_data`. Function definitions compliant with RBApy are supported, including linear, exponential, Michalis Menten, and indicator, supporting x- and y-ranges. The values used are based on the RBA model `Escherichia-coli-K12-WT` (https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models/tree/master/Escherichia-coli-K12-WT), determined from experimental data and/or have been fitted to improve protein prediction. An initial RBA model could be configured with constant values instead of growth dependent values.\n",

    "In the Python dictionary `mach_data`, the detailed composition of each process machine is recorded. This composition is subsequently utilized to generate the table `machineries`. The model of a process machine is that of a large enzymatic complex consisting of multiple proteins with a defined stoichiometry (`stoic`), based on literature or adjusted to proteomics data. This complex may also encompass accessory proteins, such as elongation factors and ribosomal RNA. \n",
    "During the process machine's creation, metabolites from the reaction network may be produced or consumed. The column labeled `set` serves to define the type of macromolecule in question, with options including ‘protein’, ‘rna’, or ‘None’ for metabolites. Macromolecules are assigned an identifier (`id`), and corresponding gene products are automatically added to the model based on the configured gene product identifier (`gpid`) and gene label (`label`). The mass of the macromolecule is allocated to the configured cellular compartment (`compartment`). A `notes` column is included in all tables to allow for the recording of additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macromolecules are composed of elementary components, the attributes of which must be defined, as well as the manner in which these components are processed. Respective data is initially collected in `pm_data` and subsequently utilized to generate the table `processing_map`. Processes are linked to their corresponding processing map using the `processingMap` identifier. Attributes for elementary components are defined with `set` set to the type of macromolecule (‘dna’, ‘rna', or 'protein'). In this case, the component identifier is set in `component`, a descriptive name is set in `name`, and the weight is set in units of average amino acid weight in `weight`. The weight of amino acids is configured to 1, the weight of RNA nucleotides is converted to the average amino acid mass, and the weight of DNA nucleotides is set to zero, indicating that there is no weight impact. Cofactors utilized in the translation machinery are assigned a weight of zero as well. The processing of components consumes and produces metabolites as defined in `reaction_string`and loads the processing machine by the value specified in `machinery_cost`. Special values assigned to `component` initiate processing for a specific set of elementary components, such as ‘amino_acid’ or ‘cofactors’. The ‘constantProcessing’ value specifies an initial processing step during the production of a macromolecule."

    "\n",
    "In the RBA, individual compartments are configured with a capacity constraint in units mmolAA/gDW, which in turn constrains the amount of protein and RNA macromolecules located in these compartments. Individual protein and RNA macromolecules can be assigned to specific compartments by explicit configuration, as is done for components of process machines and tRNAs. Alternatively, protein assignment to compartments is done automatically. The location of the metabolites that participate in the reaction catalyzed by such protein determines the reaction compartment identifier assigned to them. Proteins catalyzing transport reactions can be allocated to membrane compartments. Specific roles can be assigned to compartments. For instance, the `cytoplasm` compartment serves as the default compartment, the `medium` compartment delineates the external environment, and the `uptake` compartment is designated for transport reactions associated with medium uptake. It is noteworthy that transport reactions for medium are automatically configured with a Michaelis-Menten type saturation function, where the Michaelis constants are all set to the default value of $K_M = 1\\frac{mmol} {l}$. This must be taken into consideration when setting medium conditions in the optimization loop. \n",

    "The configuration data, delineated in table `compartments`, facilitates the generation of individual compartments (`id`) within the RBA model. This process entails the allocation of descriptive names (`name`), the definition of reaction compartment identifiers (`reaction_cids`), the establishment of roles (`keywords`), the setting of capacity limits, and the configuration of translation targets for the dummy protein.\n",

The translation targets for the dummy protein [mmol/gDW] can be defined in three different ways: as a constant value (`translation_target_constant`), as a function definition (`translation_target_function`), or as an aggregate of functions (`translation_target_aggregate`).

    "In the context of FBA and GECKO modeling, the biomass reaction, also referred to as the \"growth\" reaction, functions as a proxy for the growth rate. This reaction consumes energy equivalents and metabolites, which are primarily utilized as precursor metabolites for the production of macromolecules at a fixed composition. The flux through the biomass reaction corresponds to growth-associated maintenance and metabolite dilution by growth. This dilution imposes an additional burden on the reaction network, compelling it to generate sufficient metabolites to maintain constant metabolite concentrations, despite the increase in total cell volume due to growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "During RBA model construction, the biomass reaction is replaced by variable and fixed concentration targets, which get diluted according to the growth rate. Metabolites in the biomass reaction can be split into a variable and a fixed part. The variable part contains energy equivalents and precursor metabolites that are used for producing protein and rRNA macromolecules. The RBA model optimization determines the concentrations of these macromolecules, depending on the cellular requirement and the constraints imposed. To ensure the growth dilution of metabolites contained in the fixed composition part of the biomass, so-called \"target concentrations\" need to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration of target concentrations for metabolites (small molecules) and DNA, tRNA, and mRNA macromolecules is achieved through the table designated as \"targets.\" Additionally, the configuration of specific flux targets is permitted within this table. Targets can be arbitrarily grouped by means of the `target_group` attribute. The `target_type` can be assigned the values 'concentrations' to ensure growth dilution of target metabolites and macromolecules, 'reactionFluxes' to enforce minimal or maximal metabolic fluxes, or 'productionFluxes' / 'degradationFluxes' to enforce macromolecular production or degradation fluxes. The target metabolite (e.g., 'M_pi_c'), macromolecule (e.g., 'mrna'), or reaction (e.g., 'R_ATPM') is specified by the `target` attribute. A group of metabolite targets can be created using \"<reaction_id>, 'metabolites'\", which extracts from <reaction_id>, usually the biomass reaction, metabolites appearing as products (excluding amino acids and nucleotides) with their stoichiometric coefficients. This creates individual concentration targets for each metabolite by multiplying the stoichiometric coefficient with the constant value provided in `target_constant`. A group of tRNA macromolecular concentration targets can be created in a similar fashion using \"<reaction_id>, 'amino_acids'\", where the target value would correspond to the total mass concentration of tRNAs in mmol/gDW, and individual tRNAs distribution would be extracted from the amino acids in the biomass, according to the tRNA to amino acid mapping configured in the table `trna2locus`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The process of loading the RBA model using the cobrapy interface is analogous to the loading of a GECKO model. However, while GECKO models can be optimized natively by cobrapy, this is no longer the case with RBA models. Optimization in this context necessitates the utilization of an `RbaOptimization` object, which autonomously adjusts the signs of constraints, allows setting of external metabolite concentrations, recalibrates growth rate and medium-dependent parameter values, and implements the bisection algorithm for the RBA feasibility optimization problem (`ro.solve()`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The media configuration employed for the optimization of FBA and GECKO models is converted from uptake flux to media concentrations. The medium concentrations $[S]$ are scaled to achieve the same average enzyme saturation as used for the other enzymes in the RBA model, using the following equation: $ \\sigma = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + K_M}$.  This results in the following equation: $[S] = \\frac{\\sigma}{1 - \\sigma} \\cdot K_M$, using the default value for transporters (`ro.importer_km`) of $K_M = 1 \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{l}$. The proton concentration is configured as non-limiting to avoid throttling proton symporters excessively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that results extraction is now supported by `RbaResults`. The reaction fluxes encompass fluxes from the metabolic network and macromolecular production/degradation fluxes introduced with RBA. Macromolecular production/degradation fluxes are filtered using `df_all_net_fluxes.loc[synthesis_rids]`. Protein concentrations can be extracted using the function `rr.collect_protein_results()` in units of ‘mg_per_gP,’ ‘mg_per_gDW’, or ‘µmol_per_gDW’. Similarly, RNA concentrations can be extracted using `rr.collect_rna_results()` and enzyme/process machine concentrations can be extracted using `rr.collect_enzyme_results()`. These concentrations can be expressed in units of ‘mg_per_gDW’ or ‘µmol_per_gDW’. Finally, compartment utilization in terms of percentage occupancy or actual utilization can be extracted using the function `rr.collect_density_results()`."

    "\n",
    "The development of a RBA model necessitates a significantly greater investment of effort compared to a GECKO model, yet it offers the advantage of generating more realistic models. The utilization of organism-specific knowledge is imperative, as it provides a foundation for defining the processes to be implemented, the compartments to be incorporated, and the compartmental constraints to be imposed. Additionally, it determines the targets concentrations and fluxes to be established, the target values to be configured, and the realistic growth-dependent functions to be designated for dynamic value assignments. The parametrizations selected for this RBA model could serve as a foundational starting point for future model enhancements and as a paradigm for RBA models of other organisms that one may wish to develop. Despite the augmented intricacy, the RBA optimization outcomes persist in demonstrating substantial correlation with empirical data, encompassing both the predicted growth rates and the predicted protein concentrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a manner analogous to the GECKO model of a particular organism serving as a precursor to the RBA model, the RBA model has the potential to serve as a precursor to a GBA model (Dourado & Lercher, 2020).The extension to GBA would entail defining default or specific reaction kinetics for each of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions and introducing metabolite concentration variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of the f2xba modeling framework is that the resulting models contain all information and annotation data from the foundational GEM, which can be exploited in downstream processing. The models are self-contained and fully compliant with the SBML standard (Hucka et al., 2019), which facilitates sharing and processing by SBML-compliant tools. However, RBA model optimization requires support from the f2xba Python package. Loading and optimization of this SBML-coded RBA model in environments other than Python would require efforts to port relevant coding sections from f2xba to the other environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent tutorials, we will augment our models with thermodynamic constraints, commencing with a thermodynamic FBA model.\n"
