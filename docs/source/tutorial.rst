Tutorial
========

The tutorial is composed of nine distinct Jupyter notebooks, which systematically 
guide the user through the workflows of creating, modifying, and optimizing various 
genome-scale extended models. These models are used as a case study to illustrate 
the principles and applications of genome-scale modeling. The latest FBA model of *E. coli* 
serves as a representative example throughout the tutorial.
